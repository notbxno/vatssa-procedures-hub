# Ground

The responsibility of SMC at Cape Town falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "Cape Town" (FACT_GND) on 121.900 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. This Excludes the H, T, Z and G aprons, these are not classed as movement areas. SMC will monitor traffic in these areas but not, under any circumstances, issue movement instructions to aircraft. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway. 

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a discrete squawk code.
All VFR fixed wing and rotor aircraft departing Cape Town, excluding SAPS and SANDF aircraft, are required to file a flightplan. 

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSCPT, start up approved, Runway 19 in use, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Restrictions

Cape Town does not have the required apron size nor taxiway surface to accommodate Code F aircraft (Airbus A380-800, Boeing 747-800s or any aircraft with a wingspan between 65 and 80 metres). That being said they are common on VATSIM and no official procedures exist to accommodate this. Controllers should always be aware that a Code F aircraft on any of the A, B or C stands will not allow for adequate wing tip clearance for aircraft taxing behind it. The solution to this is to ask the pilot if they have the adequate wing tip clearance to keep clear of other aircraft on the apron.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "BAW09P, Confirm you are able to keep clear of the Bonair A350 ahead of you?"
### Stand Restrictions

### Taxiway and Apron Restrictions

## Pushback Procedures

SMC controllers should remain vigilant at all times as, due to its layout, Cape Town has a very restricted ground flow. An aircraft pushing in the wrong direction on the main apron will have to taxi onto the runway to realign themselves with the direction of the outbound flow. 

<u>Pushback Direction</u>

| Runway in use | Direction |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| 19 | North |
| 16 | North |
| 01 | South |
| 34 | North or South depending on aircraft position  |


**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before pushback clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push clearance is issued.**

!!! info "Pushback Phraseology"
    "(callsign), push and start approved, face North, QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures

By default, all aircraft should be taxied to the full length holding point unless otherwise requested by a pilot.

<u>Intersections</u>
| Runway in use | Intersection | TORA |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| 19 | Full length | 3201 | 
| 19 | Rwy 16/34 int | 2630 |
| 19 | E | 1875 |
| 01 | Full Length | 3201 |
| 01 | Ch | 2080 |

### Taxi Restrictions 

Code F aircraft may only use the main apron to access their assigned stand and not as a thoroughfare due to reduced wing-tip clearance. Code F aircraft will need to exit the apron by the shortest possible route and taxi along the runway, exit via runway 34 or M to access the departure end of the runway. 

*Insert image of Code F taxi route*

### Non-movement Areas

The H, T and Z apron are non-movement areas. No movement instructions may be issued to aircraft within these areas. Aircraft should be instructed to taxi at their discretion and hold short of the movement area. 

*Insert Image highlighting non-movement areas*

### Hotspots

Precision approach holding points are established at A2, G2 D4 and B3. During low visibility procedures (LVP) aircraft are to be instructed to hold short of these holding points. If the aircraft does not read these back clearly or the controller is unsure, the controller should confirm with the aircraft.

*Insert Image highlighting CAT2 holding points*

### Arriving Aircraft
Upon arrival into Cape Town, inbound aircraft are to provide their aircraft registration (tail number) and their parking bay (stand number) that they desire. You must check that their requested stand is in compliance with the restrictions listed above. If so, then the aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay. If not, ask the pilot for a different stand, or feel free to assign one yourself.
