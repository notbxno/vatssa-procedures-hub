# Ground
The responsibility of GMC at GVNP falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, There is no designated GND position so this will be TWR's responsibility. GMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. GMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with GMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* *Persons on Board* (Optional)
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the GMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At GVNP, filing a flight plan as VFR is mandatory.

!!! Tip "VFR Phraseology"
    "GPHPY, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 06, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."


## Restrictions

On all taxiways the largest aircraft that operate at GVNP IRL is the A320N operated by Multiple airlines, **No larger aircraft are permitted to operate at the airport IRL**. However on VATSIM pilots dont understand this so you may get A/C larger than the A320N, as a result of this ATC *may* deny pilots if they do this however this is not recommended


### Taxiway and Apron Restrictions

There are no specific restrictions howevercaution must be taken by controllers to keep pushbacks efficient due to the small size of the apron, a controller must ensure the traffic remain clear of each other and to allow enough space for vacating traffic to fully vacate to remain efficient.

!!! Warning
    If GVNP, ever hosts CAF or CTP, **Mashallah Marlon, thats what we want,** pushbacksa must be planned to ensure aircraft dont miss slot times and cause delays.

## Pushback Procedures

Pushbacks must be done in the direction of the runway in use

!!! failure
    Use common sense bassically


!!! tip "Phraseology for pushback"
    "TOM1VY, Push and start approaved Face North/South, QNH XXXX"



### Arriving Aircraft
When an aircraft arrives into GVNP, They should be instructed to taxi straight to the gate, this is due to the small ground movement area.

!!! Tip "Phraseology"
    "TOM1VY, taxi stand XX via E"
