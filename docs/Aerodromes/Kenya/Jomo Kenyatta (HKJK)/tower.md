# Tower
The responsibility of Tower at King Shaka falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "King Shaka Tower" (FALE_TWR) on 118.450. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Durban CTR from GND - 3000ft MSL.

!!! note
    As the frequency for departure is already handed in the IFR clearance, handoffs to the next ATS unit (Durban Approach) is not required with departing aircraft.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft

  * There are no published VFR departure or arrival routings in and out of the Durban CTR. Traffic should instead be asked to report either leaving or entering the CTR, or via of the VRPs.
  * Circuit altitude is 800ft, with circuits conducted towards the sea. Runway 06 (Right Hand), Runway 24 (Left Hand).
  * Controllers should avoid extending downwinds signicifantly to avoid conflicts with traffic at Durban Virginia.

!!! info "Circuit Clearance"
    ZSABC, hold position, after departure Runway 06, right hand circuits, not above 800ft, report right downwind Runway 06.

!!! info "Exit Clearance"

    ZSABC, Runway 06 at Intersection G, wind 080 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff, bye bye.

## Runway 24 Hotspot
!!! warning
    During Runway 24 operations, there is an increased chance of conflict with vacating aircraft at G, and taxiing aircraft to the holding point Runway 24.
    In this case, Tower may issue aircraft instructions to vacate right at the end at Charlie to avoid a potential conflict with prior coordination from Ground.
